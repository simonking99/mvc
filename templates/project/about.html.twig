        <h1>About the Blackjack Project</h1>
        <p>
            This is a multiplayer Blackjack game built using Symfony. Three players can play against a shared dealer.
        </p>

        <h2>How the game works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to <strong><a href="{{ path('proj_login') }}">/proj/login</a></strong> to enter player names.</li>
            <li>Each player starts with a balance of 1000 kr.</li>
            <li>Players place their bets and are dealt two cards.</li>
            <li>Players can choose to Hit (draw a card) or Stand (end their turn).</li>
            <li>Once all players are done, the dealer plays automatically according to standard rules.</li>
            <li>The game determines the winner based on scores, 21 wins, anything over 21 is a loss.</li>
            <li>Players who lose all their money are removed from the game.</li>
        </ul>
